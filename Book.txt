Construction of individual drawknobs

The finest stop action known to humans, is, unquestionably, the pull-out
drawknob.  Such drawknob has two stable states -- on and off -- with
mechanical moving action.  In the electronic case, this drawknob will
require a solenoid to allow Combination Action and General Cancel.

While exceptionally nice, solenoid pull-out stop controls are also very
expensive and complex to build.  A close fuctional alternative, would
be a push knob: the state of the stop is indicated by an LED situated in
the center of the knob.

The construction of an array of push knobs is simple.  The ø1 3/4"
wood handles are glued to ø7/8" axis rods.  The rods go through closely-
fit ø7/8" round holes in the face board.  On the back, they are screwed
to the support planck
